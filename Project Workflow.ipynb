    "To create a workflow diagram based on the provided `main.py` and related library files (`section_writer.py`, `structure_writer.py`, `title_writer.py`, `stats.py`, `markdown.py`, `pdf.py`), we'll outline the sequence of operations and interactions between the main components. This diagram will illustrate how the libraries and functions are called within the application.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **main.py** acts as the entry point, handling user interaction through Streamlit's UI components. It initializes necessary variables and states, including disabling buttons and managing session states.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the form is submitted, it first validates the length of the topic. If valid, it proceeds to disable the submit button to prevent multiple submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, it calls `generate_book_title` from `title_writer.py` to generate a title for the book based on the provided topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. After generating the title, it calls `generate_book_structure` from `structure_writer.py` to outline the structure of the book, including its chapters and sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. With the structure in place, it uses `generate_section` from `section_writer.py` to fill each section of the book with content, leveraging AI models to generate detailed and structured chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Throughout the generation process, `GenerationStatistics` from `stats.py` tracks and displays the inference statistics, such as tokens per second and total inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Once the content is ready, `create_markdown_file` from `markdown.py` converts the generated content into a Markdown file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Finally, `create_pdf_file` from `pdf.py` takes the Markdown content and converts it into a PDF document, which can then be downloaded or displayed to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "This diagram simplifies the flow and focuses on the primary interactions between the main script (`main.py`) and the supporting libraries. Each step represents a function call or operation that contributes to the final output, demonstrating the modular architecture of the application."
